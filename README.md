## Swagger UI

The Order Management System provides a Swagger UI interface for easy interaction with the API. You can access the Swagger UI by opening the following URL in your browser:

`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#`


The Swagger UI allows you to view and test the available API endpoints and their documentation.
